2. Does age affect the programming language used?
3. Around the world, which countries utilized the most used programming language ?
4. Specifically in the US, which state used the most commonly used programming language the most?

# Percentage of Respondants Who Used Different Programming Languages
Using 3 dataframes that showed the percent of languages used per country, we were able to merge some data that showed which of the 3 top languages were used most by each country. This image shows that JavaScript is the most used programming language in the top 15 countries with the most respondants, except for China. China respondant's used Python more than any other programming language.

# Final Analysis

Of the 80,000 respondents who answered the survey on Slack, JavaScript was the most widely used programming language. 

United States and India were the two countries who used JaveScript the most and California was the state with the greatest JavaScript usage. 

Our data showed that men were more likely to use JavaScript compared to women.
