# Percentage of Respondants Who Used Different Programmin Languages
Using 3 dataframes that showed the percent of languages used per country, we were able to merge some data that showed which of the 3 top languages were used most by each country. This image shows that Java Script is the most used programming language in the top 15 countries with the most respondants, except for China. China respondant's used Python more than any other programming language.
