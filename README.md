# Project Narrative
The objective of this project is to determine which programming language is the most popular among the tech community. Our data source was derived from the raw .csv file included in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2021: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey.

Hypothesis: Javascript is the most widely used language in the tech community.

# Questions
1.  Is there a preference amongst the genders?
2. Does age affect the programming language used?
3. Around the world, which countries utilized the most used programming language ?
4. Specifically in the US, which state used the most commonly used programming language the most?

# Percentage of Respondants Who Used Different Programmin Languages
Using 3 dataframes that showed the percent of languages used per country, we were able to merge some data that showed which of the 3 top languages were used most by each country. This image shows that Java Script is the most used programming language in the top 15 countries with the most respondants, except for China. China respondant's used Python more than any other programming language.

# Final Analysis

Of the 80, 00 respondents who answered the survey on slack, JavaScript was the most widely used programming language. 

United States and India were the two countries who used java script the most and California was the state with the greatest java script usage. 

Our data showed that men were more likely to use java script compared to women
